# Nostr SafeBox
Your own private safebox on nostr!

## General Concept 

Nostr SafeBox is like those hotel safeboxes where you put your passport and money in while you are travelling. Digital travelling should be no different. You should be able to access your safebox whenever you need it - and get rid of it, when you no longer need it.

Still super-early - working on the concept of a ‘safebox’ for Nostr. It’s a generalization of the wallet concept for storing secure, private personal information.

The idea is that the safebox contains different item types, wallets, records, etc. The safebox index will be a replaceable event and the items parametrized replaceable events with opaque ‘d’ tags. The safebox has an ```nsec``` (it can be yours, not recommended ) or one generated by you or a custodial service. The safebox can be used by any service/client that knows the safebox ```nsec```

Initial implementation will be a Python class that is invoked by a command line utility. The eventual goal is to create a drop-in component for a custodial service.

You can install via pip. Make sure you have a virtual enviroment set up first
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/trbouma/safebox.git
safebox info
```



Alternatively, if you have Poetry installed, you can do the following:
```
poetry new safebox
cd safebox
poetry add git+https://github.com/trbouma/safebox.git
poetry shell
safebox --help
```
Before you start using, you need a few settings for your nsec, relays and mints. 




No guarantees. No promises of support. This is very experimental - more to come!
